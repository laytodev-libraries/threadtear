# Contributing

You are welcome to contribute to anything of this project, 
but please try to avoid using other languages than java (you can use kotlin, but I would be happier if java was used), 
and the language level has to be strictly java 8 or lower. Make sure you use the recommended formatting of this repository.
If you are creating a new execution, you can override the `getAuthor` method, and your preferred name will be shown in the GUI.
Try to make separate pull request for different changes / additions.
